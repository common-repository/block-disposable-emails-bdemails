The one plugin you need to block disposable/fake emails.

== Description ==

This plugin prevents people from registering with disposable email addresses like the ones provided by mailinator (also known as throw-away email, one-time email). It protects your most important asset, your registered user base, by preventing contamination by fake accounts. This plugin working principle is similar to spam blacklists.

It hooks in the wordpress function is_email() so it will extend the known email validation of wordpress to detect fake/disposable domains.

The plugin itself does not contain a list of domains to block. Instead of local maintenance the plugin uses the service of https://bdemails.com. This is a very accurate free service for at least 50 API requests per month.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What about privacy =

This plugin does NOT submit email addresses. I do not run this service to collect your subscribers data.
Before the data is sent to https://bdemails.com the domain part is separated. So only the domain part is sent. For further information see the mentioned website.

= What happens if the service is down =

Our team is working hard to keep the servers up and running all the time.
Even if the service is down your users are able to leave comments and/or register.

= Is this service FREE =

Yes, it is. Our service it is ABSOLUTELY FREE. There are no costs at all.
If you like our service you can donate.

= I need more than 50 API requests per our =

If you need more than 50 requests per hour please send us an email at: requests   [at]   bdemails   [dot]   com
Let us know more about your service as we give to our users more than 50 requests if they need.

= Why should I use your service =

It is bad to have such addresses in your userbase for several reasons. And yes, it is easy to block *.ru addresses, known domains as trashmail.net, and some others â€“ but they are changing continuously. This service currently detects more than 23k domains. So maybe it is a good alternative for your manually maintained blocklist.

= Can I prevent or report false positive =

This should be happen very rarely. In this case I kindly ask you to report this mistake at: report   [at]   bdemails   [dot]   com
